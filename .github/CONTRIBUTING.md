### Styling

* Indentation: 4 spaces
* Line-endings: LF
* Trailing newline: yes

### Requirements

* Must have the date on the first line, in YYYY/MM/DD format
* For subdomains, add a comment for a needed CNAME
* If the application needs further configuration, specify this in a comment

* In most cases we want the comments for Authelia, ldap and basic auth to be present
* If the application has known API endpoints, we prefer these to be exempt from auth through a location block (provided the application has security on the endpoint)

* Files must not be executeable
